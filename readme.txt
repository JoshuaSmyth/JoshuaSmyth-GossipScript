Gossip Script is a scripting language for video games.
Although it is technically node based it uses a custom syntax made to be quite human readable.

It offers the following improvements over ComposerScript.

- Run Multiple Scripts at the sametime.
- Run Multiple node trees at the same time in a single script.
- Proper evaluation of conditionals (With correct precidence.)
- Scriptable build pipeline.
- Engine Agnostic.
- Autosave Support.
- Better modeling of inventory items, quests, reputation etc...
- Static Declaration of variables, tags, states and bitstates.

There is currently no UI/IDE planned.


TODO:
 - Evaluate Conditionals
 - Define and Read/Write and Serialise Variables.
 - Create Sample Game!
